 ## Relations, sponsors, and conflict
 
 XI.	How to deal when things break and go wrong
An important section that will inevitably be used, it will provide some sort of reference that is aligned with the groupâ€™s goals and mission instead of leaving the response to the first organizer there.
XII.	Conflict resolution
How conflicts will be resolved, this will no doubt be critical. The author intends on modeling this after the system in CHUM (Coop Housing, University of Maryland) a student organization he is involved with.
XIII.	Outreach, sponsors and University Relations
A general guideline and current procedures to how to go about this in a way that makes the group friends.
XIV.	Optimal communication strategy
This is a subject being actively developed as a way of making communication of ideas and changes to open, yet not a madhouse, to be inclusive yet swift. It is being formulated by Eric Weiss and some associates.
XV.	Website and online presence
Probably a more technical section on how the website operates and other pertinent information.
XVIII.	Donations and gaining Resources
A section on how donations have been gotten, both monetary and material. May or may not be combined with other sections as needed.
